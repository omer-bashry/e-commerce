# Project Name: React E-Commerce Website

## Overview

Welcome to my React E-Commerce project! This application is a feature-rich web store built using React, Bootstrap, Material-UI, and Redux. It leverages the power of Vite for a fast and efficient development experience. The project interacts with the Fake Store API to fetch product data, utilizes Redux for state management, and makes API requests using Axios.
